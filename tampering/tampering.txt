The vulnerability originates from transmitting the "name" property in the request as an unsanitized string, exposing it to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 
This vulnerability permits attackers to alter the input, potentially endangering the system's security. 
The secure version addresses this issue by cleansing all received properties and variables in the request, thus obstructing any unauthorized alterations.

Tampering infringes upon the Integrity aspect of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) model.

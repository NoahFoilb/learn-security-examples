- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability is linked to the absence of a reliable logging system capable of accurately tracking user messages. In its insecure state, users can impersonate any userID to post messages, rendering the logs untrustworthy due to the inability to ascertain the true identity of the message poster. Additionally, the information captured in the logs is limited, typically including only the userID and message content. A secure version would authenticate and validate a user's identity through a session before any logging activity, and it would capture more comprehensive details such as the date, request method/url, and user IP address in the logs. Enhancing security further could involve implementing robust authentication methods to verify user identities reliably. Additionally, ensuring the logs are protected against tampering by users is crucial for maintaining their integrity and reliability.
